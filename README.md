# Responsive-Portfolio
Used my original HW-Wireframe Recommended from last week. 
Added media queries at the bottom of my existing style.css sheet.
Used Media queries 980px, 768px; 640px. 
I think this was hard to get started because alot of my original 'HW Recommended' from last week wasn't perfect. I had to go in and add alot of specific widths and positions for the media queries and so I feel like I provided too much information under each media query. I need to spend more time on these but I think I am slowly starting to get the gist.
I was having an issue with the header {position: static} for when the screen size became 640. I have linkedin and contact floating left.
